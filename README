This is a collection of poems that are written in
Python.  Some of them solve Project Euler problems,
some of them are small games, some of them do other
things, like finding prime numbers.

I try always to relate the words of the code and the
actions that the code executes, so there is confusion
in the mixed layers of metaphors.  This is not an
obfuscated code repository; not really.  In some ways,
it is the opposite.
